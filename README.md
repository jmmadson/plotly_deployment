# Bellybutton BioDiversity

## Project Overview

For this project, we were organizing and presenting data from a study that looked at the bacteria found in various human test subject's bellybuttons. 

We had to organize and maniuplate the data, and output it into dynamic charts to allow users to see data by indvidiual test subject. We used JavaScript (D3 and Plotly Libraries), CSS, Bootstrap and HTML in the project to pull together an interactive page to display our data.
